You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li> </ul> <p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely.
