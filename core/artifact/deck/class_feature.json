Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:call-lightning\">Call Lightning</a>, that you've already cast.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
